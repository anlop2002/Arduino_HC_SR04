# Arduino_HC_SR04

This projects is meant as a sensor to determine if a car has passed certain point where a garage door can be closed without hitting the car.

The red LED will be on as the car crosses the garage door threshold. As soon as the car passes that threshold and the path for the door is cleared the sensor will no longer detect the car and the green led will light up, indicating that is safe to close the garage door.
